## What is this project for?

Many services, products and operating systems are secretly collecting general analytics on services without giving the use knowledge of this going on. This is not acceptable and needs to stop. The user should be given informed consent without coercion into having general analytics of them and their devices collected by random companies and often processed by larger companies like Facebook. To be clear, I am not against this practice as a whole, I just want people to be informed that it is or isn't happening.

## What are the rules for a setting from a service to be entered into this Github page?

If you would like to add a setting from a service into this database or instructions on how to stop certain data collection, the following must be made certain of beforehand:

- It must not impact the user experience of the given service (e.g. Turning off analytics sharing in iOS stops some data collection and doesn;t affect user experience).
- The names of the products, services and operating systems must be inputted into alphabetical order for your pull requests. Don't make my life hard please. I will deny any major errors made in formatting and whatnot if you do this.
- There will be a proper example in the future.

More rules may be added in the future, but this is what I have for now.

## Is this the final product?
Oh heavens no! This is just a concept thing at the moment. I am not very well versed in this Github thing just yet so if you have any ideas, please shoot me a message or do a pull request or whatever else you can do to suggest change. I would greatly welcome it! Some long term plans for this include
- A website that collects this data and displays it in a user friendly manner, similar to [https://plexus.techlore.tech/](https://plexus.techlore.tech/)
- A better CSV too, because this one I have now is realtively alpha stage and I am not sure exactly how to do things with it yet.
If this does ultimately only stay as a CSV for my benefit though, I am ok with that too. You should only help out if you think this is worthwhile.
