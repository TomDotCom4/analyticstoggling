# Contribution Instructions

If you want to make a contribution, please read the following beforehand.

## RULES
- Your entry must be alphabetised in order of the names of each service. For example, Discord's entry should be above the entry for Evernote in the CSV.
- The setting you highlight cannot impact the user experience of the application or OS in question. This list is designed to be a change that any person can make without having to make any change to the way they use that application or OS.
- Please keep your spelling and syntax correct, especially for the names of software.
- Always order the operating systems/platforms in order of the following: iOS/Android/macOS/Windows/Linux. This will help keep things standardised.
- Keep the instructions as brief as possible while still remaining clear. Something like a "settings path" to where you need to go and the specified toggle (either on or off) will go a long way here (e.g. "Settings>Privacy>Analytics & Improvement>Share iPhone Analytics (Turn OFF)" is a good instruction for turning off iPhone Analytics on an iPhone. A link to the relevant setting if it can be altered in a website is also good (e.g. https://www.spotify.com/au/account/privacy/)

## NOTES
- You can include pretty much any piece of software on any OS, this includes regular applications, web applications or PWAs, video games and video game systems and anything else.
- This is still in an alpha stage, these rules may change depending on what is done with the CSV. I am still not entirely sure what is going on with this myself.
